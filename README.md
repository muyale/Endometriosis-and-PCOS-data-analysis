# Endometriosis 
In this project I study Endometriosis and PCOS on various scales including the social and mental effects these diagnoses have on women.
Endometriosis  is an often-painful condition in which tissue that is similar to the inner lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. It often affects the ovaries, fallopian tubes and the tissue lining the pelvis.Endometriosis tissue acts as the lining inside the uterus would and  thickens, breaks down and bleeds with each menstrual cycle. But it grows in places where it doesn't belong, and it doesn't leave the body. When endometriosis involves the ovaries, cysts called endometriomas may form. Surrounding tissue can become irritated and form scar tissue. Bands of fibrous tissue called adhesions also may form. These can cause pelvic tissues and organs to stick to each other.


# Common symptoms of endometriosis include:

Painful periods-Pelvic pain and cramping may start before a menstrual period and last for days into it. You also may have lower back and stomach pain. Another name for painful periods is dysmenorrhea.
Pain with sex.-Pain during or after sex is common with endometriosis.

Pain with bowel movements or urination.-You're most likely to have these symptoms before or during a menstrual period.

Excessive bleeding-Sometimes, you may have heavy menstrual periods or bleeding between periods.
Infertility-For some people, endometriosis is first found during tests for infertility treatment.

# PolyCystic Ovary Syndrome

PCOS  is a very common hormone problem for women of childbearing age. Women with PCOS may not ovulate, have high levels of androgens, and have many small cysts on the ovaries. PCOS can cause missed or irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth, acne, infertility, and weight gain.Women with PCOS may be at higher risk for type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, and endometrial cancer.
# Common symptoms of PCOS 
Missed periods, irregular periods, or very light periods

Ovaries that are large or have many cysts

Excess body hair, including the chest, stomach, and back (hirsutism)

Weight gain, especially around the belly (abdomen)
Acne or oily skin

Male-pattern baldness or thinning hair

Infertility 

Small pieces of excess skin on the neck or armpits (skin tags)

Dark or thick skin patches on the back of the neck, in the armpits, and under the breasts

# PROJECT 

Given a dataset provided by Southampton University I sought to study endometriosis and pcos using the various answers given by female respondents . My main objective was to try and analyze how these diagnoses affect women socialy and emotionaly .
#importing dependencies 
For my project I used matplotlib,seaborn and pandas for analysis

Next I looked at the distribution of age in the dataset ,to see how the respondents were distributed agewise

I removed null values but and this was my resulting dataframe

Next analysis was on the school year of all the respondents ,such a beautiful visualization

I had to check how many women missed school due to to periods ,it is commonplace that women feel stigmatized during their periods

Heaviness of menstrual flow can be an indicator of underlying diseases and so I had to explore that 

![Screenshot (105)](https://github.com/muyale/Endometriosis-and-PCOS-data-analysis/assets/111242297/0caf473a-9247-489c-a1e7-707158e6d6eb)

Women who  miss school due to painful periods can have an underlying disease ,or so I proposed ?

For period pain taking pain medication such as ibuprofen, naproxen or paracetamol may help to relieve menstrual cramps and pain in the study some of the women stated what medication that they used .

I explored some symptoms in the data set such as aching outside vagina and bloating

Next I explored the total number of women diagnosed with Endometriosis 

![Screenshot (111)](https://github.com/muyale/Endometriosis-and-PCOS-data-analysis/assets/111242297/d7562a3f-9ea2-4abf-a880-2f4a325a0724)

I checked the total PCOS diagnosed women

Does a certain age have endometriosis than another for example does 13 yos have more likelihood of  having Endometriosis 

![Screenshot (113)](https://github.com/muyale/Endometriosis-and-PCOS-data-analysis/assets/111242297/3c838290-623d-49d5-95a2-928c92cc353b)

If a woman has other female family experiencing severe period pain it may be an indicator of these diseases being in the genes and so may be inherited

How many have mothers and sisters having endometriosis ?

# Endometriosis diagnosis by Data Analysis 

Could bowels indicate Endometriosis or pcos ? Pain in the bowels should say something isn't it ?

Lethargy is highly linked to Endometriosis,lets look at the results

What about headache and dizzines ?

# PCOS 
Using pandas I sliced the dataframe to come up with pcos diagnoses 

![Screenshot (119)](https://github.com/muyale/Endometriosis-and-PCOS-data-analysis/assets/111242297/c6dd5579-355c-4a04-ad0b-1bffcacf99ba)

What is the menarche ages for those diagnoses with PCOS ?

Checking if other female members have severe pain as I did with endometriosis . Most women reported yes ,a clear indication that pcos is inherited

Checking bowel pain as a symptom

#Depression among women living with pcos 
Depression and anxiety are common in women with PCOS but are often overlooked and therefore left untreated. Along with the physical disturbances, many mental problems are also associated with PCOS the responses had a lot to tell  with majority claiming to be sad once in a while . Other wonen claimed to cry once in a while a clear indication of how much this affects them emotionally.

# Anxiety among women living with PCOS

# Quality of Life
PCOS leads to decreased quality of life from mood disturbances, decreased sexual satisfaction in these women I had to check what that meant 

![Screenshot (128)](https://github.com/muyale/Endometriosis-and-PCOS-data-analysis/assets/111242297/c2dbd5ba-99fc-44b3-837f-12c60668f100)





# CONCLUSION 
Considering the social and emotional effects that these two diseases have on women ,its better that sensitization is done and regular testing be done . Overally the quality of lief for those diagnosed decreases significantly and so instead of ostracizing them we should offer support . This project aim is to teach about PCOS and Endometriosis ,the main aim was to 
bring into light how we can use data skills for good.
